STATS 415

Shengqian Jin; Hao Xu; Xinye Xu

### Procedures:
1. Data exploration ACF Plots - Absolute Values (STATS 509)

2. How to deal with NA values (replace with historical value/ drop)



### Agenda: 

3/23 or Spring Break: 

Shengqian Jin: time series cross-validation, dimensional reduction (PCA), Model Selection, 

Hao Xu: summary statistics, K nearest neighbors; Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis; Logistic regression, similar to HW framework

Xinye Xu: Trees (Bayesian regression addictive tree), (K-means),  LSTM, 



### Idea:

We want to test whether past related asserets price can predict the movement direction of bond market (AAA bond) and stock market (S&P500) in US of future dates. These features include Fed interest rate, VIX index, Exchange rate of US with China and EU, Emerging bond index. 
Both supervised and Unsupervised techniques, such as KNN, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Bayesian regression addictive tree. Also, the more advanced models, such as Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) might be used as the benchmarket to compare the performance.  Lastly, we will apply Model Selection methodologeis to compare the performance of differed model and discuss futuere improvement.
